# Human Activity Recognition with Single-Photon LiDAR
Below are some results of Human Activity Recognition on depth frames captured by a 32*32 pixel Single-Photon LiDAR array operating at 1550 nm. The data contains 6 activities recorded during daylight at 325 meters at Heriot-Watt University.
We have trained a recurrent neural network using real motion data captured by a motion capture suit mapped to different virtual characters. The network classifies a 32 frame input depth video sequence and outputs a confidence value per activity, that is visualized in the videos.

This work has been submitted to Optics Express under the title: "Human Activity Recognition at Kilometer Range using Single-Photon LiDAR", and is currently under review. This page will be updated when the work gets published.

The videos below show the results of the 2 actors perform walk, then a mix of activities.
